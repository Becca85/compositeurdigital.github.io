# 360° sequence

Use this content type to display a 360° view of objects from a sequence of pre-rendered images (e.g buildings)

## Interaction in the Compositeur Digital

On a 360° sequence you can:

- Move forward and backward in the sequence of images using the slider

## Content management

- Folder extension: `sequence`
- Supported file extension in the folder: `jpg`, `png`
- Images are ordered in the Sequence viewer as they are in the file explorer

## Layers

If you have multiple layers to display (the different floors of a building for example), you can organize your images into .sequence folders for each layer, and put them in a global .sequence folder. 

Here is an example : 
- Building.sequence
  - Floor 1.sequence
    - 001.png
    - 002.png
    - ..
  - Floor 2.sequence
    - 001.png
    - 002.png
    - ..
